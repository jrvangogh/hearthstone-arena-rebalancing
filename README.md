Process:
* Scrape Hearthstone card data from HearthSim's project and link it to arena tier list data scraped from HearthArena's online site
* Perform initial analysis of each classes' strength based on tier list data
* Use tier list scores as a metric for the creation of new formulas for arena card offerings which have more give each class a more balanced distribution of cards

Results:
* To my surprise, the 9 classes had very balanced arena drafts from a purely tier list score perspective

Notes:
* Hearthstone card data in JSON format obtained from https://hearthstonejson.com/
* Tier list scores obtained from http://www.heartharena.com/tierlist
